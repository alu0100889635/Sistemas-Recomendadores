1. Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimstone and dried herb. The palate isn't overly expressive, offering unripened apple, citrus and dried sage alongside brisk acidity.
2. This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.
3. Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors. The wine was all stainless-steel fermented.
4. Pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish.
